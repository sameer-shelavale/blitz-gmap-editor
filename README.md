 1. Users are able to draw elements on the Map and apply styles using the DrawingManager? provided in GMAP API version 3
 2. Users will be able to export the created map as a JSON object which can further be stored in database.
 3. The stored JSON map can again be retrieved and displayed in Edit or non-edit mode as required.
